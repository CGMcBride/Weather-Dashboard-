# Weather-Dashboard-

This weather dash board is to show multiple cities weather, you can also add the city of your choice such as "New York" for example if you would like to know the tempature there. This project was also to display the use of ajax and how to call an API from a server to bring information to my website with an API key. When you look at the weather dash board you will notice the icon on display for what the weather is showing to look like the temp, wind speed, humidity and UVindex.
